LEAD is and Illinois based non-profit that is working to further
encourage and inspire students to investigate STEM (Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Math). Project LEAD utilizes a unique
combo of digital, and real-world interactions. Project LEAD's team
members have contributed to numerous events and have reached out to
schools in multiple states. &nbsp;Our members are particularly fond of
Maker Faires and have been makers a 2 in 2013 (and hopefully more in
2014!). Project LEADs main goal is to spread STEM through online means.
Facebook and YouTube drive most of Project LEAD's traffic, and Project
LEAD has reached nearly every country that has access to YouTube, and
even some that aren't supposed to (we can't say we aren't happy about
that).&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></div></body></html>
