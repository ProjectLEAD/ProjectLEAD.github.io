<h3>The Gang</h3>All of the Project LEAD board members are good
friends, and have either gone to school together, or ahve met during
special events. The 2 founding members of Project LEAD that remain are
John Moosemiller, &nbsp;and Daniel Jiang. When starting Project LEAD's
non-profit track he enlisted 3 fellow students and friends Moses Chan,
Atreya Laxman, and Arpan Rau. Together we've made Project LEAD what it
is today!<br><br><h3>John Moosemiller</h3>John Moosemiller is a rising
Sophmore at the University of Houston majoring in Chemical Engineering.
Outside of school you can find John playing games, and doing stuff for
Project LEAD, or any one of his other pet-projects.<br>Interests
outside of his major are focused on electronics, and software
development. He's the creator of this app, and is looking to expand his
knowledge and put it to work in other fields.<br>John is one of the cofounders of Project LEAD, and manages a majority of Project LEAD still (*AHEM* this website *AHEM*)!<br>A
sampling of his current and former job titles are: Cofounder and Member
of the Board of Project LEAD, Summer Intern at the University of
Chicago's Computation Institute, Calm and Collected Customer Assistant
at RESTLYE Chicago,&nbsp;TA UH Cullen College of Engineering.<br><h3>Moses Chan</h3>A
complete and utter friend to all things mechanical, the member of
Project LEAD that always seems to have an extra 'alan wrench' when you
need it most.<br>Moses has played a part in our app-development, 3D printing, Maker-faire activities, and more.<br>Moses
is a rising sophomore Mechanical Engineering major at THE Ohio State
University. He plans to focus on robotics in his studies AND spare
time. He was an active member in FIRST Robotics, and plans to continue
his interest in robotics with<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the addition of another 3D printer to the Project LEAD family.<br><br><h3>Daniel Jiang</h3>A
real whiz at everything that you aren't. Daniel makes up the bulk of
the Project LEAD design team, and has created all of the wonderful
logos you see around Project LEAD Pages.<br>Daniel is a rising
sophomore at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign where he is
studying physics with a minor in awesomeness.<br>He is one of the cofounders of Project LEAD, and has helped guide us in our mission!<br><br><h3>Atreya (Jai) Laxman</h3>Current
Rising Sophomore at the Universit of Illinois Urbana Champaign. Jai has
helped us with some of our planning, and with the production of some of
our legal documents. He is probably studying something really dificult
in college because<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
he was unable to email me a bio for himself even though he's been out
of school for 2 weeks.<br><br><h3>Arpan Rau (Arpsy/ie?)</h3>He likes
robotics, and is taking a gap year before college, so hopefully he is
able to build up a bio for himself by the time that I update this
website.<br>He like robots, and balloons. That's why he's the only one of us to ever get a paycheck from NASA.
